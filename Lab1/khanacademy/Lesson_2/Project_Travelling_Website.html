        <h2>Main info about country</h2>
        
        <p id = "Country-main-info"><em>The Republic of Kazakhstan</em> is a unitary state with the presidential system of government, which gained independence <em>on December 16, 1991.</em> It is divided into 17 administrative zones and populated by about <strong>130 ethnic groups</strong> - namely by Kazakhs, Russians, Uzbeks, Ukrainians, Uighurs, Tatars, Germans and others.</p>

        <h3>The most modern cities:</h3>

        <ul id = "cities">
            <li>Astana</li>
            <p>Astana, formerly known as Nur-Sultan, Akmolinsk, Tselinograd, and Akmola, is the capital and second-largest city of Kazakhstan with a population of 1,350,228 within the city limits after Almaty, which had been the capital until 1997.</p>

            <li>Almaty</li>
            <p>Almaty remains the largest, most developed, and most ethnically and culturally diverse city in Kazakhstan. Due to development by the Soviet Union and relocation of workers and industries from European areas of the Soviet Union during World War II, the city has a high proportion of ethnic Russians and Uyghurs.</p>
            <img src = "https://cdn.nur.kz/images/1120x630/e2aa461b12505546.jpeg" alt = "The view of city of dreams" width = "330">
            <li>Shymkent</li>
            <p>Shymkent is a city in southern Kazakhstan, located near the border with Uzbekistan. It holds the status of a city of republican significance, one of only three cities in Kazakhstan with this distinction, alongside Almaty and Astana.</p>

            <li>Aktau</li>
            <p>Aktau is one of the most fascinating and unusual cities in Kazakhstan. Its name is translated from Kazakh as "the white mountain." The city lives up to its name because it stands on a white limestone rock. Aktau is best known for its beaches and the sea; however, it can offer much more.</p>
